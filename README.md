Have u ever noticed the dark black shadow on your wallpaper? Do u want to remove it? Now it has become possible with new jailbreak tweak WGradRemover. It removes this shadow and makes you wallpaper untouched by iOS. Tweak is compatible with all devices on iOS 7.0 to 9.1

Tweak has two latest versions: **1.0-3** which only removes shadow (you can download it at BigBoss repo) and **1.0-4** which also changes status bar color (there is no update in BigBoss repo yet so you can download .deb [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniilpashin/WGradRemover/master/debs/com.daniilpashin.wgradremover_1.0-4_iphoneos-arm.deb) and install it with Filza File Manager or iFile)

You can watch demo below.
